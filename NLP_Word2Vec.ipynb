        "Smiling seems to have a favorable influence upon others and makes one likable and more approachable.[4] In the social context, smiling and laughter have different functions in the order of sequence in social situations:\n",
        "Smiling is sometimes a pre-laughing device and is a common pattern for paving the way to laughter;\n",
        "Smiling can be used as a response to laughter.[5]\n",
        "Smiling is a signaling system that evolved from a need to communicate information in many different forms. One of these is an advertisement of sexual interest. Female smiles are appealing to heterosexual males, increasing physical attractiveness and enhancing sex appeal. However, recent research indicates a man's smile may or may not be most effective in attracting heterosexual women, and that facial expressions such as pride or even shame might be more effective. The researchers did not explicitly study the role of smiles in other sexual preferences. Perceive smiling as a negative expression and consider it unwelcoming. Too much smiling can be viewed as a sign of shallowness or dishonesty.[8] In some parts of Asia, people may smile when they are embarrassed or in emotional pain. Some people may smile at others to indicate a friendly greeting. A smile may be reserved for close friends and family members. Many people in the former Soviet Union area consider smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even suspicious behavior,[9] or even a sign of stupidity.[10]\n",
        "Systematic large cross-cultural study on social perception of smiling individuals[11] documented that in some cultures a smiling individual may be perceived as less intelligent than the same non-smiling individual (and that cultural uncertainty avoidance may explain these differences). Furthermore, the same study showed that corruption at the societal level may undermine the prosocial perception of smilingâ€”in societies with high corruption indicators, trust toward smiling individuals is reduced.\n",
        "Happiness is a positive and pleasant emotion, ranging from contentment to intense joy. Moments of happiness may be triggered by positive life experiences or thoughts, but sometimes it may arise from no obvious cause. The level of happiness for longer periods of time is more strongly correlated with levels of life satisfaction, subjective well-being, flourishing and eudaimonia. In common usage, the word happy can be an appraisal of those measures themselves or as a shorthand for a \"source\" of happiness (for example, \"find happiness in life\" as in finding the meaning in life). As with any emotion, the precise definition of happiness has been a perennial debate in philosophy.\n",
        "n the other hand, there have been many studies that have found genetics to be a key part in predicting and understanding happiness in humans.[56] In a review article discussing many studies on genetics and happiness, they discussed the common findings.[57] The author found an important factor that has affected scientist findings this being how happiness is measured. For example, in certain studies when subjective wellbeing is measured as a trait heredity is found to be higher, about 70 to 90 percent. In another study, 11,500 unrelated genotypes were studied, and the conclusion was the heritability was only 12 to 18 percent. Overall, this article found the common percent of heredity was about 20 to 50 percent.[58]\n",
